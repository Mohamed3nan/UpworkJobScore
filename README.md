## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This boilerplate is updated with:

- [Chrome Extension Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Dev Server 4](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
- [React Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh)
- [react-refresh-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by and adapted from [https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate), with additional support for React 18 features, Webpack 5, and Webpack Dev Server 4.

Please open up an issue to nudge me to keep the npm packages up-to-date. FYI, it takes time to make different packages with different versions work together nicely.

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **18**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change the package's `name`, `description`, and `repository` fields in `package.json`.
4. Change the name of your extension on `src/manifest.json`.
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
6. Run `npm start`
7. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
8. Happy hacking.

## Structure

All your extension's code must be placed in the `src` folder.

The boilerplate is already prepared to have a popup, an options page, a background page, and a new tab page (which replaces the new tab page of your browser). But feel free to customize these.

## TypeScript

This boilerplate now supports TypeScript! The `Options` Page is implemented using TypeScript. Please refer to `src/pages/Options/` for example usages.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  ‚Ä¶
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  ‚Ä¶
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Intelligent Code Completion

Thanks to [@hudidit](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react/issues/4)'s kind suggestions, this boilerplate supports chrome-specific intelligent code completion using [@types/chrome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/chrome).

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: '123' };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from 'secrets';
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.

## ‚û°Ô∏èOverview
Upwork Job Score is a browser extension designed to help freelancers by rating job postings based on various criteria.
This intelligent scoring system allows users to quickly identify the most promising opportunities, helping them focus on high-quality jobs and avoid wasting connects on low-quality jobs. It enables freelancers to make better decisions when selecting jobs to apply for.


## ‚û°Ô∏èHow it works
Upwork Job Scorer analyzes each job posting and assigns a score based on several key factors. These scores help you determine which jobs are worth applying to.

The scoring system takes into account the following factors:

- **Client Payment Status:** Checks if the client has a verified payment method.
- **Proposal Size:** Evaluates the number of proposals submitted by freelancers.
- **Estimated Budget:** Analyzes the client's budget for the project.
- **Estimated Time to Complete:** Evaluates the project's timeline.
- **Client Rating:** Considers the client's rating on Upwork.
- **Client Payment History:** Checks how much the client has spent.
- **Job Posting Time:** Looks at how recently the job was posted.
- **Experience Level Required:** Determines the experience level the client is seeking.
- **Client's Country:** Evaluates if the client is from a high-paying country.
- **Featured Job:** Checks if the job is marked as featured.

Jobs are then tagged with different badge colors based on the score:
- **Green Badge (7.0+):** üü¢ Excellent
- **Light Green Badge (5.0-7.0):** üü¢ Good
- **Yellow Badge (3.0-5.0):** üü° Average
- **Red Badge (below 3.0):** üî¥ Poor

## ‚û°Ô∏èUsage
1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Go to the Upwork "Find work" page.
3. (Optional) Click on the Upwork Job Score icon in the Chrome toolbar to set the minimum score for hiding jobs (default is 0).

## ‚û°Ô∏èContributing
We‚Äôre open to contributions! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## ‚û°Ô∏èDisclaimer
